# LLama2-like Transformer Model Code

## Overview

This Python code implements a simplified Transformer model, inspired by LLama2, for text generation. It handles:

- Loading a binary model checkpoint.
- Extracting weights and configurations.
- Performing forward passes through a Transformer network.
- Generating tokens step-by-step with a prompt.

## Key Components

### 1. **Model Loading**

- Reads a binary model file (`LLAMA2_MODEL_PATH`) containing parameters.
- Parses configuration variables: dimensions, layers, heads, vocabulary size, etc.
- Extracts and reshapes weight matrices using `struct.unpack` and `numpy`.

### 2. **Tokenization**

- Uses `SentencePieceProcessor` to tokenize input and decode generated output.
- Initializes tokens with a beginning-of-sequence token (`bos_id`) and encodes the prompt.

### 3. **Key Functions**

- `rms_norm`: Implements Root Mean Square Layer Normalization.
- `softmax`: Computes the softmax for attention scores.
- `silu`: Applies the Sigmoid Linear Unit activation function.

### 4. **Rotary Embeddings**

- Generates complex rotary embeddings for positional encoding.

### 5. **Transformer Mechanism**

- **Attention Layers**:
  - Computes query (Q), key (K), and value (V) projections.
  - Applies scaled dot-product attention with masking for autoregressive generation.
  - Uses cached K and V for efficient computation across steps.
- **Feedforward Network**:
  - Applies non-linear transformations with SiLU activation.

### 6. **Token Generation**

- Iteratively predicts the next token based on current context and appends it to the sequence.
- Decodes the generated token sequence into text.

## Output

The script generates text starting from the provided `prompt` using autoregressive token generation.

## Example Parameters

- `temperature = 0.8`: Controls randomness of generation.
- `n_tokens_to_generate = 100`: Number of tokens to generate.

## Notes

- The code assumes a binary model file and tokenizer model are correctly set in environment variables.
- It is a minimalistic implementation focused on understanding the core mechanism of Transformer-based models.
